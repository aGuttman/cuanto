## Workflow

We follow the common Gitflow Workflow. A quick [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) on the Gitflow Workflow is available from Atlassian.

In brief, the core of the workflow consists of the following:

- Basing feature branches off of the `develop` branch.

  ```
git checkout -b some-feature develop
```

- Merging into the `develop` branch via pull requests.
- Reserving the `master` branch for releases.
